# Term-Project-NLS-on-Y-graph

## This is the term project I submitted for the Numerical Methods course at McMaster University. 

The main goal of the project is to solve the Nonlinear Schrodinger equation on the particular type of the graph, known as Y-graph. The method used is Collocation approach based on Chebyshev approximation with Gauss-Lobatto-Chebyshev points.

The report is provided in the pdf file. In Section 2 we show the steps to transform the initial problem into the discretized algebraic system for the nodal values. We also show how to treat the aliasing error of the nonlinear cubic term. In Section 3, we provide with the computational results tested on the initial data corresponding to the stationary NLS solution, known as a standing wave, and it can be seen that the method gives a spectral convergence and the relative error for N = 129 collocation points is negligible.
